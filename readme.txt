== Frequently Asked Questions ==

###X Feature is not working. What should I do?

Open a ticket [here](https://mangobuttons.com/support). Describe what isn’t working, what should be happening, and provide the name of the theme you are using.

###When I deactivate or uninstall the plugin, will my buttons still work?

Yes...well...sorta. The will be completely functional, but they probably won't look too pretty. If you deactivate mangobuttons but want to keep all your buttons, you can add this code to your theme's css file to cause every mango button to appear like a normal link on your site: `.mb-button{ background-color:transparent !important; }`.

###When I deactivate or uninstall the plugin, is all my data deleted?

Currently Mango Buttons does not store any data on your site.

###What information (if any) is sent to third-party sites (such as mangobuttons.com)?

By default, no information is sent to mangobuttons.com. You can opt in to receive infrequent product updates, in which case only your email address and website URL are saved to our mailchimp newsletter list.
